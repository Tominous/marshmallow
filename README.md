# Marshmallow 6 Bandicoot

Marshmallow is a *m o d u l a r* Discord Bot that's sloppy coded. That's why it's Open Source, so you can help make it better!

## Quick Install
You'll still need to configure it yourself, which is described in our wiki.

```
git clone https://github.com/radwolfdev/marshmallow.git
cd ./marshmallow
npm i
mv config.example.json config.json
move config.example.json config.json
```

Don't report an issue if `mv` or `move` fails.
