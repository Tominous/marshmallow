# Marshmallow Core

## Premature End of Support (until further notice).

>  "I don't think others apart of the Radwolf team will be working on Marshmallow. You can contact me on discord via Curtis#0708 if you want to take over this project, we'll discuss more from there.  
> *Don't get me wrong, It's been fun making Marshmallow. If you are deciding to take over Marshmallow, I wish you best of luck :). Thanks to everyone who used Marshmallow, even the users who's been there ever since Marshmallow wasn't even named Marshmallow! Those people should have a role on the Discord Server.*"

Marshmallow is a *m o d u l a r* Discord Bot that's sloppy coded. That's why it's Open Source, so you can help make it better!

If you want to install this bot, go to our [wiki](https://github.com/radwolfdev/marshmallow/wiki)

If you like our work, support us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rekkisomo)!

## Quick Install
You'll still need to configure it yourself, which is described in our wiki.

```
git clone https://github.com/radwolfdev/marshmallow.git
cd ./marshmallow
npm i
mv config.example.json config.json
move config.example.json config.json
```

Don't report an issue if `mv` or `move` fails.
